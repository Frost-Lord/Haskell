# Haskell Project Guide

This repository contains several example projects illustrating key concepts and functionalities in Haskell.

## Project Summaries:

### 1. Logging
The 'Logging' project demonstrates basic IO operations in Haskell. The code simply prints "Hello, Haskell!" to the console.

### 2. Functions
The 'Functions' project is an introduction to defining and using functions in Haskell. It includes examples of a function to add two numbers together, and a function to concatenate two strings.

### 3. Typeclasses
The 'Typeclasses' project covers the basics of typeclasses in Haskell. It includes a custom typeclass called 'Showable' and instances of 'Showable' for the `Int` and `Bool` types. The project also includes a function that prints the 'showValue' of a 'Showable' type.

### 4. Pattern Matching
The 'Pattern Matching' project demonstrates the use of pattern matching in function definitions. It provides examples for checking if a number is positive, negative, or zero, calculating the factorial of a non-negative integer, and concatenating two lists.

### 5. List Manipulation
The 'List Manipulation' project provides examples of how to manipulate lists in Haskell. This includes doubling each element in a list, filtering even numbers from a list, summing all elements in a list, and generating a list of numbers within a given range.

### 6. Monads and IO
The 'Monads and IO' project is an introduction to monads and IO operations in Haskell. It includes a function that asks for the user's name and greets them, and another function that performs an IO operation.

### 7. Modules and Packages
The 'Modules and Packages' project shows how to define and import custom modules in Haskell. It includes a module called 'MyModule' that contains a function to greet a user.

### 8. Error Handling
The 'Error Handling' project demonstrates error handling in Haskell. It includes a function that divides two numbers and handles the case of division by zero, as well as a function that handles the result of the division operation, printing an error message if one occurred, or the result if it was successful.
